The privacy of the location is the best part of the experience and what's not to like about watching shooting stars at night around a roaring campfire.

We cook all of our meals there except when we go to Tawas to get G's Pizza on Thursday night - it's tradition! We plan to return in August of 2019 to create more happy memories. Have you created family summer memories recently? It's time to check our Sutton's Sunrise/Sunset."

        "Great week. It was our first family reunion and everyone had a great time. Loved the spot along the water. Reminded everyone growing up on Lake Huron. The resort was a great meeting spot for everyone people loved the nostalgic cabin feeling. The main house was set up nice to cook and serve meals. the yard had enough room so all of us could reminisce and play corn hole. Down by the water was a nice place to hang out with a fire pit there and a deck to roast smores and watch stars. No complaints with anything. Everything with the vacation agency went smooth. I saw no reason why we wouldn't use the facility in the future. Yes a beach would be nice but we still went swimming",
        "would be tough for little kids. Growing up on Lake Huron you know it changes. Nice being close to town."

        "We rented this cabin for 3 nights with 2 adults and 2 children and had just enough room to be cozy but still comfortable. The cabin is small so if you plan to spend a lot of time inside I'd suggest renting elsewhere but it was perfect for us: we wanted to be close enough to hear the water at night and walk out the door into the sand all day and that's exactly what you get staying in cabin 1 or 2. Fires at night were perfect on the beach in the provided fire ring and leave your sand toys",
        "rafts and chairs at home as there a plenty there to borrow. This cabin is very quaint and not updated to newest amenities but fit us perfect for an unplugged weekend away at the beach. The Perfect Landing team provided great communication and responded to any concerns and questions we had quickly. We will definitely be back!"

There is a very nice fire pit in the back yard and plenty of lawn chairs for all to sit.\n There is a nice outdoor shower as well but one should spray it for spiders on the day you arrive if you would like to use it.\n It is located next to the state park and in a very quiet neighborhood. We never did locate the trail to the water however most of our time was spent at the Blues Festival that was in town and enjoying the great company with all of the family that showed up.\n I would definitely recommend this place and would come back here as well.\n \n Papa Bill & Kathy",

The living room has 2 separate areas so the adults played cards on one side while the children watched a movie on the other - it was awesome. The beds were comfortable and clean. The kitchen was well-stocked and we had absolutely everything we needed to make and serve food and drinks. The back patio is fantastic and has a great round table with comfy chairs and an umbrella. We had such a wonderful time and we can't wait to book this place again."

The owner of lakefront cottage is a crazy nut when it comes to his property he wants no one on his property period. And guess what his sister owns the other side of the Queen bee. So he threatens to tow your vehicle your parking spot is no bigger than my car so he can legally do it. He went completely crazy on me about 5 ft of parking. He mowed between the cottages from 10 am to 530pm sat. Crazy let the mower sit and just run. DO NOT GO THERE FOR LAKEFRONT OR PEACE AND QUIET YOU WILL GET NEITHER. You have 10 ft lake access crazy man up front has boat hoist all along his beach to block you. Then to top it off he patks his van so you can't even see the lake. But Perfect Landing did credit me a day of my stay they felt bad about this. DONT DO IT",

      "review": "We arrive first to the wrong place thanks to Google maps. It changd the street to lane and I didn't realize it until we arrive to a place with no home. But when we did arrive to the right place the first thing I did was check to make sure it was clean. It was very clean. Then we checked out the view in the back yard. Nice little fire pit by that water. My brothers fished the whole weekend. I also enjoyed sitting by the water in between raindrops. I don't recommend the middle of July reading other peoples reviews that were left in the notebook at the house. It rained the whole 3 days were there. But the house was like home. Had everything we needed. Good thing it was a cool weekend because the portable air didn't cool the house down but the one room. We brought board games and ends as there was no t.v I slept in the room with the bathroom. The bed was a little hard and Uncomfortable for myself. We met the neighbor to the right. Very friendly. We ended up having some beers with him and he let my brothers take out his paddle boat. That would be something the rental should invest in could be some kind of water thing. A paddle boat or kayaks would be nice. The rental is close to town we did check out the bowling alley and the local Irish pub. We would come back and definitely recommend this rental to family and friends. In face I video chatted my mom and gave her a tour. The price wasn't that bad either.",

Being right on the water front was a must for me and this fit the bill perfectly. The walk to the beach area is short and dry. You have your own private beach front and the water was so clear and fresh! I enjoyed swimming and no rocks on the lake floor",
        "just cool clean sand. So very quiet and relaxing. Two recommendations: Michigan is getting hotter these days in the summer so AC would be nice. The cottage had box fans so we used those and the water off the lake kept the cottage comfortable. Temps were in the low eighties at day and 65-70 at night. July 14-17 when we stayed. We rented a couple movies for movie night but could not watch them as we could not figure out how to use the 3 remotes to get the DVD player working. Instructions for that would have been nice. Overall I would highly recommend this cottage. Perfect landing associates were helpful and responded timely to our needs."

Furniture definitely has not been moved for a good cleaning in a long time. I wouldn’t have noticed but having to set up pack and plays and making it safe for the kids I had to move a few things. Bathroom door handle fell off while my toddler was in the bathroom thankfully door wasn’t shut all the way or she would have locked herself in. Doorway thresholds could use some trim since there is a big difference going from room to room. I had to put rugs over all the door ways so my little ones didn’t get hurt.

There was a grill but we didn't end up using it so I'm not sure how well it worked. They provided hand soap and dish soap but you might want to bring shower gel for the shower. They had a nice area to sit around the fire pit if you were so inclined and a nice swing down by the water. Although the cabins are fairly close together and you can see onto everyone's deck",

        "WalMart etc. Now the Cons: there were only full size beds and the box springs were squeaky and needed replaced. This wasn't bad enough that I couldn't sleep but they weren't the best. The dishwasher was really loud so you don't want to run it before you go to bed. There was a coffee pot under the sink so we assumed it was broken but I didn't test it because I brought my own. It would have been nice if there was a dish drainer under the sink so you had a place to put your dishes if you washed them by hand and if they put some dish towels in a drawer by the sink. My husband was disappointed that there was a rocky bottom in the swim area but we brought our water shoes so it wasn't a big problem. The kids that were there seemed to enjoy it all right. We mostly floated around in our tubes so it was fine with me.\n \n Overall this is a lovely place and we would gladly come back again when we are in need of some rest and relaxation!"

        "Pros: there was plenty of room for everyone to sleep. Two bedrooms upstairs and 1 bedroom downstairs with an additional full size bed and twin in the basement. The wrap around porch was nice. It was kid friendly for the most part. The grill had propane and the kitchen had pots/pans",

I was not prepared to see brown water coming out of the faucet. Truly looked like dirty lake water and smelled. My only other complaint is if you’re the type who needs some sort of fan to sleep with make sure you bring your own fan. I was told their were “ceiling fans throughout the house” when I asked if there was A/C. This was not the case. Only one working ceiling fan located in the living room. There is one ceiling fan in the bedroom but it is not hooked up we were told. That was a major bummer because it’s was very warm in the house making it miserable to try and sleep. Also it states washer/dryer so I was excited to be able to do our laundry there as we stayed so I didn’t have to do it all when we got home. The washer did not work but the owner came over to look at it and stated he would get a new one in there after we left. Didn’t help us but it was nice they were going to replace it. And there isn’t a dishwasher like it states?"

I wish there was small plastic cups. There were only huge plastic or very heavy glass cups. Was kinda hard with kids. Asking them to be very careful all the time.

My kids and grandkids loved having a beach to ourselves as we love the water and spend every possible good day playing and having fun. The firepit near the water was a great gathering place in the evening as we wound down from the day's activities. The grandkids start asking right after Christmas when we are going to Tawas again. As parents and grandparents we like the fact we can see everyone in the water easily which allows for more relaxation for the  big  kids. The accommodations were perfect - we especially like having a microwave for those quick meals on the go. We cook all of our meals there except for one day out for G's pizza. I would highly recommend this location for the serenity",

The kitchen sponge was an old used sponge that appeared to have food stuck to it from the last time it was used. We looked all over for a new one and I had to call my sister before she left her house and ask her to bring a new sponge from home so we would have something clean to wash dishes with. I'm not sure who is responsible for cleaning this place but I feel as though someone needs to reevaluate the services because I don't consider myself a clean freak",

And everything you need is right at hand just bring your food. It's listed as a two bedroom but has a small room off the back with a single bed that can be used as a 3rd bedroom which is nice. The kitchen is a great place to gather with family and friends along the modern high top table with cute little stools. The fire pit outside is a great place gather and enjoy each other company. They also have a cute little patio area outside with table",

Just a short little walk down to the water edge which is beautiful and the neighbors are all very friendly.

You are about 3 minutes outside of town and it is set back behind a few trees and you can almost drive by without seeing it. 3 cabins sit on its own perfect little beach which has the most beautiful sunrises (I really recommend getting up at 7am and sitting on the beach in one of their many swings or picnic tables and watching the sunrise). We had a family of 4 and fit very comfortably and enjoyed our stay. There is a grill on every deck",

The morning after we checked in a lady that works for the company was in the next cabin working and we explained the situation (she was very nice) and she had maintenance out within a hour. he attempted to do what he could (apparantly previous tenants also had issues) but shortly after he left it was back up to 82 degrees. We had to keep windows open at night and we went and bought a fan just to try to stay cool. The shower is pretty small also......but the cabin truly is set up cute",

The cabins were very tidy and quite clean",

The water was beautiful blue. Our suggestion would be to bring fans...as it was very hot when we arrived in July...and there is no air conditioning",

I'm a business owner so rarely do i get to take a full week off but this place met our expectations and really helped me to\" recharge\" my batteries! To kind of explain my ratings I have to say only a couple things were negative. Today is our last day and it rained and we went to the screened in porch but it was leaking pretty bad from the two skylights. Secondly when we got here we found one of the beds still had sheets with spots of some recent \"activity\". I realize thats a cleaning oversight but it is one that can create a negative cleaning impression. The screened porch also had a slider door with ripped screen and no handle. These are small things and nothing is ever as perfect as we all like. The comfort...location and gorgeous beach and view far surpassed those negatives. I plan on booking to return here....Love it!!",

The only complaint that most in the party had was the noise from the individuals on the 2nd floor very early in the morning. I was able to fix this with an extra beer at night and some ear plugs. If you are a good sleeper this may not bother you. This is a very beautiful area",

My only disappointment was due to the photos available on the site that I booked from. The photos made it look like the property was located right on the beach with its own walkway right to the water. That wasnt the case however. Instead we didnt even find out about the path in the photo until our last day. The neighbor saw us and told us we could cut through another person in the areas yard to access that path to the water in the photo. I wish we had known about it the whole trip. Also none of the photos I saw showed how close other homes actually were to you. Besides all that it was a great experience and I would recommend to others.",

The upsides asides of this place are 1) the location 2) the neatness of the house",

From beginning to end the experience with perfect landing rentals was fast and prompt; we felt lucky to have gotten the chance to be able to enjoy a long weekend with no cell phones just with the family here! We sat outside and were shocked to see a Beautiful bald eagle fly by",
        "and the loons were a welcomed sight as well",
        "and great Bon fires. The house itself was perfect and really had a great up north appeal! If you love being outdoors and sipping coffee while watching the sun rise with loons singing in the distance these are the perfect cabins to come and reconnect with what matters!!!"

      "review": "Well where should I start I stayed at grandview 2 in august of last year and had a great experience. This year was a completely different story I booked very well in advance and showed up on my booking day about 6 pm which is already 2 hours past minimum check in. Walked up to my cabin to see clothing pillows and garbage around the inside and outside of the cabin. When I looked closer I also saw a ridiculous amount of flys and I'm not talking 2 or 3 I'm talking 20 or more flys. My fiance and I called the office which told us it should of been cleaned and the cleaning people were on there way. We sat until after 7 pm and the cleaning people finally arrived and told us how sorry they were and blamed it on the office ( perfect landings) after perfect landings told us it was the cleaning companies fault. So we decided to see what the cabin was like after they cleaned it and sat until 8:30 pm mind you we arrived at 6 pm. We walked in the cabin which to be honest had been cleaned perfectly fine except for the ridiculous amount of flys still buzzing around the cabin. I couldn't justify staying and paying over 120 dollars for a fly infested cabin so we decided to make the 4 hours drive home at 9 pm. We have been told we will be refunded and such but actually told they didn't have to refund us and normally they wouldn't truly sad when you pay good money for something and get far from what you expected. I will not be going back to the cabins and giving money to a company that put the blame on the cleaning company who then put the blame on the rental company who just plainly said well sorry we don't own the cabins nothing much we can do.",

It was close enough to things to do with family and to get groceries and small items and far enough away that it didn't feel \"busy.\" The beds were slightly hard but it was awesome that we didn't have to bring our own cookware and bedding. Much better than a motel! A great place to have a relaxing vacation. We will use this place everytime we are in Michigan!",

Our grandson was able to play with his cousins and the kids could go back and forth between cottages. We used to stay on the point years ago and we're disappointed that the area where we usually walked to go to the beach has been fenced off. We rode our bikes to the beach and around the park. Went to the music on Newman St on Tuesday night and Marion's twice. We loved the hammock and the outside shower. The TV and wifi were great! We will definitely plan to return.",

        "so it was hard to swallow the fact that no towels are provided for 8 people (in other vacational rentals we have stayed in",
        "if a home is to accommodate so many people they usually provide towels for that many people) There were large ants everywhere",
        "and spider webs and spiders everywhere. For example let me share one especially harrowing experience with spiders. I had a 3 month baby and as I went to put her in her little bed we brought",
        "I saw a large spider sitting on her blanket. In the middle of the night I had a carpenter ant crawling on my arm. I made my husband wipe down the wood paneled walls covered in spider webs. How difficult is it for the cleaning crew to wipe off the spider webs off the walls? The shower smelled moldy and had some mold in the corners. Just to note the rooms are very small and the walls are thin and have little knot sized holes in them Sound travels easily.I felt like I was camping inside our cottage. My husband thought the cottage was nice",
        "especially since is bottom line and concern is the price. I felt creeped out",
        "but it is slightly better than staying in a tent or trailer. It worked for our needs and things were basically minimally cleaned. I imagine it's hard to keep ants out",
        "but I highly recommend a pest control service spray for spiders and ants because they were everywhere! (smaller ants crawled in the kitchen carpet and counters) My sister came down for a day from WI and stayed in little strip of rooms available on the same property and her room smelled like mildew and was very similar to a run down cheap hotel. This property is in such a lovely location and has such potential to be wonderful. It's such a shame that it wasn't cleaner and better maintained."

The excellent location made up for some of the quirkiness of the cottage. We spent about 45 minutes replacing some of the burnt-out light bulbs. There were still quite a few fixtures that don\\'t have working bulbs- especially outside. Never did figure out how to get water running in the outdoor shower. Wonder if an instruction sheet about this could be provided. The toilet seat in the full bath in the main house is the wrong size/shape - awkward and uncomfortable. My biggest problem with the house was the mildew that was thick in the grout in the green tile half-bath. It really needs to be scrubbed.",

We are sorry for any inconvenience this may have caused and would have been happy to come out to the property and replaced them ourselves so you did not have to. Sometimes bathrooms may build up moisture and the grout just needs to be bleached and scrubbed like you mentioned. We will also touch base with House keeping on this item.

It looked like the windows had not been cleaned in a really long time. Needs more lighting - almost impossible to read with the dim lighting. Also there is a lack of lamps. Had to move one out of the bedroom to the living room. Upon arrival found the garbage pail had been knocked over and garbage was scattered on lawn. It would be nice if garbage from last tenant was removed so both garbage pails would be empty and available for the new tenant. On a positive note the water pressure was great!",

The kids found the huge closet upstairs filled with toys and movies and had a blast playing up there."

They also rent paddle boats and kayaks. call Greg for details 989.450.4445. Bedrooms have curtains for doors but does offer some privacy. Very nice place to visit and watch the sunset in the evening.

We had a Memorial for my mom who passed away in November. We spend many years on the river with her as kids and it was a way to get close to her again and visit our childhood. It had been 31 years since we had been back to Oscoda. The town really hasn't changed that much. We are so glad we planned this trip and this home was perfect for what we needed. Greg K."

Given the fact the weather was virtually the best of this whole summer with temps ranging from 80-90? most days & total sunshine can make any vacation splendid. This cottage was so roomy & comfortable on a large private property perfect to spread out with tall trees to provide shade when need be. Then there's the beach! Gorgeous clean clear Lake Huron with nice hard packed sand underneath making the trip out into deeper water a real pleasure in contrast to some of the other great lakes which force you to wade out into seaweed and slime or sharp rocks. There was hardly anyone one around at any given time so it seemed like our own private beach! Close to all the amenities in case you run out of anything",

We could feel the stress and tension draining away. My husband looked at me and said  we really get to stay here?  We enjoyed the beach view from the kitchen and the deck",

We adored the beach - Hurondezvous has one of the nicest stretches of beach in the neighborhood! It is deeper than most from the house to the water",

Of course my husband loved being able to fish in the pond and I must admit I enjoyed it a myself just for the fact that at Enchanted Evenings I could actually catch fish. . . and they were the biggest blue gills and perch me or my husband had ever seen! Our favorite aspect of this beautiful home was the location. There were no neighbors around and it's off the main road far enough to be secluded while it's still a straight shot to get to town. We had the huge amount of property all to ourselves. When we were outside we didn't have to worry about being bothered. %100 quality alone time. But when we needed something town was only a 10 or 15 minute drive. Inside of the house is also very accommodating and clean. The kitchen had everything we needed for indoor and outdoor cooking; the living room furniture was both comfy and big enough for both my hubby and I to cuddle up and catch a movie on the flat screen; the bedroom overlooks the property which was very \"enchanting\" when waking up in the morning- it makes you feel rich!; even the basement has some cool decor to keep you entertained if you enjoy some up close wild life! In fact",
        "on top of the  luxuries  this house has",
        "everywhere you look there is some fascinating souvenir from a far away place or special memorabilia to keep you entertained. This house made the memory of our  honeymoon ! Anywhere else we would have stayed in the area would have just been somewhere to stay while we honeymooned. \"Enchanted Evenings\" created the experience and we are so grateful for the opportunity to stay in this amazing house!"

        "but this place made it all the more so! The trails",
        "the privacy",
        "the host/owner was the stellar charm of the place! He shared his space",
        "some veggies from the garden and his time with us. We were beyond grateful. Enchanted Evenings was clean",
        "open and inviting. The view in the mornings was fantastic and remained that way the entire time we were there. The deck is huge",
        "the amenities on the deck (grill",
        "furniture) were perfectly suited to our needs. And the space inside was comfortable if we got to hot or too cold. We had 9 of us there and all of us had plenty of room to roam. The evenings were SO QUIET and the stars lit the way for us to see beauty in every direction. We sat by the stream after walking thru the trails and it was heavenly (to use the biggest word I can think of to describe). We also had a couple of girls who fished in the pond - and we saw a swamp monster (massive turtle) that we created entire stories around in the evenings by the fire pit. AND THAT SHOWER!!! Personally",
        "I missed that shower for a good month after I went back home to my own. NICE! We will be returning every year! Special thanks to Dennis for creating such a place and being so willing to share it."

The secluded cabin and private beach of Lake Huron was just what I needed to find some peace and relaxation from the everyday stress of life. Only having the opportunity to do this once a year is far too less so we will definitely be coming back next summer and hopefully multiple times."

We had the huge amount of property all to ourselves. When we were outside we didn't have to worry about being bothered. %100 quality alone time. But when we needed something town was only a 10 or 15 minute drive. Inside of the house is also very accommodating and clean. The kitchen had everything we needed for indoor and outdoor cooking; the living room furniture was both comfy and big enough for both my hubby and I to cuddle up and catch a movie on the flat screen; the bedroom overlooks the property which was very \"enchanting\" when waking up in the morning- it makes you feel rich!; even the basement has some cool decor to keep you entertained if you enjoy some up close wild life! In fact",
        "on top of the  luxuries  this house has",
        "everywhere you look there is some fascinating souvenir from a far away place or special memorabilia to keep you entertained. This house made the memory of our  honeymoon ! Anywhere else we would have stayed in the area would have just been somewhere to stay while we honeymooned. \"Enchanted Evenings\" created the experience and we are so grateful for the opportunity to stay in this amazing house!"

        "We utilize Enchanted Evenings for a girls weekend. This weekend was already a coveted and cherished time for the 7 to 10 of us that go every year",
        "but this place made it all the more so! The trails",
        "the privacy",
        "the host/owner was the stellar charm of the place! He shared his space",
        "some veggies from the garden and his time with us. We were beyond grateful. Enchanted Evenings was clean",
        "open and inviting. The view in the mornings was fantastic and remained that way the entire time we were there. The deck is huge",
        "the amenities on the deck (grill",
        "furniture) were perfectly suited to our needs. And the space inside was comfortable if we got to hot or too cold. We had 9 of us there and all of us had plenty of room to roam. The evenings were SO QUIET and the stars lit the way for us to see beauty in every direction. We sat by the stream after walking thru the trails and it was heavenly (to use the biggest word I can think of to describe). We also had a couple of girls who fished in the pond - and we saw a swamp monster (massive turtle) that we created entire stories around in the evenings by the fire pit. AND THAT SHOWER!!! Personally",
        "I missed that shower for a good month after I went back home to my own. NICE! We will be returning every year! Special thanks to Dennis for creating such a place and being so willing to share it."

We brought our own outdoor games (hillbilly golf) and enjoyed playing it at night in the nice yard while watching the ducks float by. They had a ton of items in the garage for the kids to play with. The main area and kitchen were really spacious so we enjoyed playing cards around the table while the kids watched a movie in the TV area. We also enjoyed cooking out and relaxing inside the screened in patio. It was clean",
